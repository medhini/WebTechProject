# WebTechProject

In this project, we are working on devising an efficient stratergy for measuring the similarity of web pages based on their DOM structure. We have referred to the following research paper - <a href= "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5569792&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5569792">IEEEResearchPaper</a>

Progress so far : 
1. Generated DOM tree for given XML/XHTML code
2. Obtained node sequence for the given DOM
